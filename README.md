ave developed an image classification model using TensorFlow and Keras for my project. This model utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and has been trained on the PlantVillage dataset. Throughout the project, I implemented various data preprocessing techniques, designed the CNN architecture, performed model training and evaluation, and saved the trained model for deployment. The project includes scripts for data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and model saving. The final model is capable of classifying plant images into different disease categories with high accuracy.
